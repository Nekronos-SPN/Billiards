# Billiards
Learning how to use GitHub with a videogame I am developing. It is not a game i want to publish or anything Im just learning. 
###### *Im not sure if I have to include files such as **.vscode** or **__pycache__***
If you want to see how it works just change in the *main.py* file the user_ball speed and its direction.
In **assets.py** you can activate Full screen mode, but it will reduce the frame to 10 for unknown reasons.
